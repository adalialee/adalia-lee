To make the interface less overwhelming and more organized, I made other minor tweaks such as alternating the timesheet row colors. Along the way in many design discussions, I added other features such as attendance and report/evaluation labels.",
            "Breaktime has a form to keep track of their young adults' workplace performance, so our project team is developing a centralized online portal/space to streamline the process. Out of the 46 wireframes that I made, these are some of the primary wireframes with workflows for weekly reports and evaluations, exporting timesheets, and deleting shifts/history. For each workflow, I had several iterations. Typically, my project managers and tech leads would coordinate a design ticket of a feature to create or improve on. Then, my project managers and I would sketch out initial ideas to present to my tech leads. After that, I would replicate the design options in Figma, receive feedback from my team, and continue refining the best designs until we were satisfied. I found that clearly labeling my design workflows and leaving comments for developers on features that might need extra clarification helped the developers more effectively translate my designs through code."
