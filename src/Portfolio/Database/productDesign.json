            "As a highly detail-oriented person, developing the component library is something that brings me a lot of joy and satisfaction. I didn’t have too many elements to make, so I created a more advanced dropdown menu. i started by setting the hover and pressed states in the prototype, then combined the elements. This dropdown will be used to switch between languages.",

            "After talking with my project managers, tech leads, and developers, I made the components more modernized by putting in sleeker icons and drop shadows. To make the interface less overwhelming and more organized, I made other minor tweaks such as alternating the timesheet row colors. Along the way in many design discussions, I added other features such as attendance and report/evaluation labels.",
            "Breaktime has a form to keep track of their young adults' workplace performance, so our project team is developing a centralized online portal/space to streamline the process. Out of the 46 wireframes that I made, these are some of the primary wireframes with workflows for weekly reports and evaluations, exporting timesheets, and deleting shifts/history. For each workflow, I had several iterations. Typically, my project managers and tech leads would coordinate a design ticket of a feature to create or improve on. Then, my project managers and I would sketch out initial ideas to present to my tech leads. After that, I would replicate the design options in Figma, receive feedback from my team, and continue refining the best designs until we were satisfied. I found that clearly labeling my design workflows and leaving comments for developers on features that might need extra clarification helped the developers more effectively translate my designs through code."

I conducted a design review of the previous site, then started creating the wireframes. I didn't realize I used the wrong typography style - my managers told me later on that they preferred thinner text in all caps.",
            "For my second iteration, I also didn't have the full picture, so the colors were off. I'd pulled a similar shade of purple from the previous site into this group of wireframes. However, I used a lighter shade to increase the color contrast and readability.",
